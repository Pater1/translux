Code related to our TransLux LED display

See project details at: https://roguehacklab.com/mediawiki/index.php/TransLux

Currently we have successfully driven the LED modules using 2 different methods: the 
ascii5x7test3.py script, running on a raspberry pi computer, and the arduinolux sketch
using a boarduino.

Currently in the process of getting http://inotool.org/ figured out to be able to 
do the arduino based stuff from the command line.
